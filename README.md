I. About Roy’s Florist
Roy’s Florist is a fresh flower shop in Winnipeg. It is owned and operated by Mr. Alan Simpson’s family. Customers can
buy the fresh flower by ordering online or stop by the shop.

II. Existing Problems
The owner wants to increase their online sales, so Roy’s Florist’s owner wishes the contents of the current website to be
able to update by ourselves in a timely manner.
At present, all contents on the website have been changed through a freelance developer who has developed this
website. But he is not always ready to assist them.

III. Solution
After the meeting with you, I had a better understanding of your problem. And I analyzed your requirements and needs
carefully.
To support you to deal with the matter, I offer you a solution. That is a Content Management System (CMS). This system
will help you proactively change any content on your website at any time.
The system will include functions as below:
+ Create a new product
+ Edit the existing product such as description, adding/deleting pictures, product name, price, size of the
product
+ Delete the product
+ Create/update/delete users who are responsible for administering the content
+ Allow the administrative users to change/recover their password.
The CMS system will have two types of users.
The first type is the users of administrator group. These users have the highest right in the system. The users can
create/delete or modify information of the other users included users in the administrator group.
The second type is users of moderate group. These users only can work on features related to the contents of product as
functions of the system are listed above except for the functions of creating/deleting or modifying information of the
other users.

IV. Cost
The total cost of the system will be $500, including the software integration and deployment tasks that will do at Roy’s
Florist site.

V. Timeline
The software will be completed and delivered in 6 weeks from the contract date.
